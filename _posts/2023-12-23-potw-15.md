### Hint
- The primary approach for problems involving factors is to employ the Fundamental Theory of Arithmetic (a.k.a. Prime Factorization).
- Beginning with the Fundamental Theory of Arithmetic, we can derive the following principles or equations: the count of factors, the total sum of all factors, determination of whether it is a perfect square or a perfect cube.
