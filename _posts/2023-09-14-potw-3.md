{% endif %}

### Solution 
{% if page.publish_solution == "true" %}
- Solution 1: 

  The prime factorization of $12960$ is $2^5 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5$.

  So, the sum of factors are 
  $$(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5)(1+3+3^2+3^3+3^4)(1+5) = 63  \cdot 121 \cdot 6 = 45738$$

- Solution 2:

### Exercise Problem
- How many positive integer divisors of $2019$ are perfect squares or perfect cubes (or both)?
- Let $N = 34 · 34 · 63 · 270$. What is the ratio of the sum of the odd divisors of $N$ to the sum of the even divisors of $N$ ?
