  Casework is a powerful problem-solving approach to solve challenge problems in mathematical competition, especially for counting problems. It involves splitting a problem into several parts, solving these parts individually, then combining together the solutions of each part.

  During the recent practice, I have noticed that many students appear to lack confidence and comfort when applying casework to solve problems.

  Having more practice is always beneficial, irrespective of the underlying reasons.

- An ant moves on a unit cube at a speed of $1$ unit per second along the edge. It starts moving from any vertex. Assuming that the probability that the ant will turn in each direction after reaching the vertex is the same (allowing it to turn back and retrace its steps). What’s the mathematical expectation of the time required for it to return to the starting point for the first time?
