  Casework is a powerful problem-solving approach to solve challenge problems in mathematical competition, especially for counting problems. It involves splitting a problem into several parts, solving these parts individually, then combining together the solutions of each part.

  During the recent practice, I have noticed that many students appear to lack confidence and comfort when applying casework to solve problems.

  Having more practice is always beneficial, irrespective of the underlying reasons.

### Problem
- In the set of $99$ consecutive integers $1, 2, 3, …, 99$, how many distinct pairs can be chosen whose sum is less than $99$?

- The cube with an edge length of $5$ is cut into $125$ small cubes with an edge length of $1$. How many times should we cut at least?

- If constant $a$ makes the equation of $$lg(x^2 + 20 x) - lg (8 x - 6 a - 3) = 0$$ have only one solution. What’s the range of constant $a$?

- There are five people practicing on the basketball court. Their tactics are: A starts serving (the first serve), after $6$ serves and runs (everyone has equal chances to serve and receive the ball), and returns to A. How many different ways are there to pass the ball?

- In the cartesian coordinate system, the points in the set $$\{(m, n) \| m, n∈N, 1≤m, n≤6\}$$ are colored red or blue. What’s the number of different coloring schemes in which each unit square has exactly two red vertices?

- In a $4×4$ chessboard, $8$ small squares are painted black, so that each row and each column has exactly $2$ black squares. How many different ways to paint?

- There are three sides in a triangular pyramid, two of which are isosceles right triangles, and the other is an equilateral triangle with a side length of $1$. How many such triangular pyramids?

- Given a sequence $0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...,$ the sum of the first n terms of the sequence is $f(n)$. For any positive integers $p$, $q$ $(p > q)$, express $f(p + q) - f(p - q)$ in the terms of $p$ and $q$.

- Among $6$ parts, there are $4$ genuine parts and $2$ defective ones. Now one part is taken out for inspection every time (it is not put back after inspection), until the $2$ defective ones are all found. What’s the probability that the $2$ defective ones will all be found in exactly $4$ inspections?

- What’s the coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion of the polynomial $(1 - x + x^2)^9$.

- From the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, · · · , 10\}$, select $5$ numbers to form a subset of the set. Take any one of these subsets. What’s the probability that the sum of any two numbers in the subset is not equal to $11$?

- Let the sequence $a_{n+1} = [\frac{a_n}{2}] +  [\frac{a_n}{3}]$, $n = 1, 2, · · · , 7$ where $[x]$ denotes the largest integer not exceeding $x$. If $a_8 = 8$, how many possible values for the positive integer $a_1$?

- Given a tetrahedron $ABCD$, each edge is painted red or blue with equal probability. What’s the probability that point $A$ can reach point $B$ through the red edges of the tetrahedron $ABCD$?

- An ant moves on a unit cube at a speed of $1$ unit per second along the edge. It starts moving from any vertex. Assuming that the probability that the ant will turn in each direction after reaching the vertex is the same (allowing it to turn back and retrace its steps). What’s the mathematical expectation of the time required for it to return to the starting point for the first time?

- Let $n ⩾ 4$ be an integer, $A = \{a_1, a_2, · · · , a_n\}$ be an integer set, satisfying $2023 ∈ A$, and the absolute value of the difference of any two elements in $A$ is a prime. How many such sets $A$?
