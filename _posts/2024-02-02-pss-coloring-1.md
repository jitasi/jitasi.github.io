  In mathematics, coloring isn't just about making things look pretty; it's a methodical approach to understanding and solving problems. By assigning colors strategically, you can gain insights into the underlying structure of mathematical situations and make the problem-solving process more manageable. One common area where coloring is used is in graph theory, but we can apply similar ideas to various math problems.

  A very famous coloring problem in graph theory is the "map coloring problem". Imagine you have a map of countries, and you want to color each country in such a way that no two neighboring countries have the same color. The goal is to use the fewest number of colors possible. This concept can be extended to other problems involving connections or relationships between different elements.

  In this series of posts, we'll explore some coloring problems in math. We'll start with the simple problems, and gradually increase the difficulty level.
