### Problem

On Halloween $31$ children walked into the principal's office asking for candy. Theycan be classified into three types: Some always lie; some always tell the truth; andsome alternately lie and tell the truth. The alternaters arbitrarily choose their firstresponse, either a lie or the truth, but each subsequent statement has the oppositetruth value from its predecessor. The principal asked everyone the same threequestions in this order. "Are you a truth-teller?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $22$ children who answered yes. "Are you an alternater?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $15$ children who answered yes."Are you a liar?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $9$ children whoanswered yes. How many pieces of candy in all did the principal give to the children who alwaystell the truth?
