### Problem

Solve the following system of equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
  3x^2 − 8xy + 4y^2 = 28 \\
  x^2 − 3xy + 2y^2 = 56
\end{cases}
$$

### HINT

- To solve an equation system, it's essential to decrease the number of variables, and the primary techniques taught in school for achieving this are elimination and substitution. 
- However, directly applying these two techniques to this equation system is not practical. We cannot identify a pair of coefficients in two equations to eliminate either x or y, and expressing x in terms of y is excessively intricate to substitute into the other equation. 
- Upon close examination of the equation system, we can observe that the left side of both equations consists of homogeneous functions. Instead of eliminating x or y, we have the option to eliminate the constant term and derive a homogeneous equation involving x and y. This is the crucial factor for solving this equation system. 
- Proficiency in Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT) can also help in solving this problem.
