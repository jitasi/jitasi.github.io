  Expected Value problems from past papers.

### Problem
- Let $X$ be a randomly chosen subset of $\{1, 2, …, 2017\}$. A positive integer $n$ is said to be ‘good’ if both $n$ and $n + \vert X \vert$ are elements of $X$ (where $\vert X \vert$ denotes the number of elements of $X$). Find the expected value of the number of ‘good’ integers.

- A box contains $8$ identical balls. There are three balls numbered $1$, three balls numbered $2$, and two balls numbered $3$. A ball is chosen at random from the box and replaced. Then a second ball is chosen at random from the box. Let $X$ be the product of the numbers on the two balls. What is the expected value of $X$?

- A fair cubic die has three faces marked with a $0$, two faces marked with a $1$, and one face marked with a $2$. The die is rolled twice. What is the expected value of the product of the numbers facing up in the two rolls?

- A bag contains one red ball, one yellow ball, and one blue ball. Balls are drawn from the bag one at a time (each of the three balls is equally likely to be drawn), and then, after the color of each drawn ball is noted, the ball is replaced in the bag. The draws continue until two red balls have been drawn in a row. Let $X$ be the number of draws needed. What is the expected value of $X$?

- A coin and a die are tossed together. Let $X$ be the product of the number that faces up on the coin ($2$ for heads and $1$ for tails) and the number of spots facing up on the die. What is the expected value of $X$?

- An ant is moving on the edges of a unit cube with a speed of $1$ unit per second. It starts from an arbitrary vertex and is equally likely to turn in any direction (including the backward direction) when it reaches a vertex. What is the expected value of the time for the ant to return to the starting vertex for the first time?

- In a ping-pong match between players A and B, the winner of each game scores $1$ point, and the loser scores $0$ points. The match ends when one player has either won $2$ more games than the opponent, or when $6$ games have been played. Let $X$ be the random variable denoting the number of games played in the match. The probability that A wins any given game is $\frac{2}{3}$, and the probability that B wins any given game is $\frac{1}{3}$. Assuming that the outcomes of different games are independent, find the expected value of $X$.
