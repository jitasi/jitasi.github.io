  Vieta formula problems from past AMC10/12 and AIME papers.

  Difficulty: AMC10/12, AIME

<!--more-->

### Problems
- [AMC10] Let $a$ and $b$ be the roots of the equation $x^2−mx+ 2 = 0$. Suppose that $a+\frac{1}{b}$ and $b+\frac{1}{a}$ are the roots of the equation $x^2−px+q= 0$.  What is $q$?
   <br />

- [AMC10] What is the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the equation $\frac{2003}{2004}x+ 1 + \frac{1}{x}= 0$?
   <br />

- [AMC12] The polynomial $p(x)=x^3+ax^2+b^x+c$ has the property that the average of its zeros,the product of its zeros, and the sum of its coefficients are all equal. The y-intercept ofthe graph of $y=p(x)$ is 2. What is $b$?
   <br />

- [AMC12] The zeros of the function $f(x) = x^2-ax+2a$ are integers. What is the sum of the possible values of $a$?
   <br />

- [AMC12] All the roots of the polynomial $z^6-10z^5+Az^4+Bz^3+Cz^2+Dz+16$ are positive integers, possibly repeated. What is the value of $B$?
   <br />

- [AMC12] Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be three distinct one-digit numbers. What is the maximum value of the sum of the roots of the equation $(x-a)(x-b)+(x-b)(x-c)=0$ ?
   <br />

- [AMC12] For certain real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, the polynomial $g(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + x + 10$has three distinct roots, and each root of $g(x)$ is also a root of the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + bx^2 + 100x + c.$
   <br />

- [AIME] Suppose that the roots of $x^3+ 3x^2+ 4x−11 = 0$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$, and that the roots of $x^3+rx^2+sx+t= 0$ are $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$. Find $t$?
   <br />

- [AIME] Let $r$, $s$, and $t$ be the three roots of the equation $8x^3 + 1001x + 2008 = 0.$ Find $(r + s)^3 + (s + t)^3 + (t + r)^3$
   <br />

- [AIME] Find the sum of the roots, real and non-real, of the equation $x^{2001}+\left(\frac 12-x\right)^{2001}=0$, given that there are no multiple roots.
   <br />

- [AIME] Consider the polynomials $P(x) = x^{6} - x^{5} - x^{3} - x^{2} - x$ and $Q(x) = x^{4} - x^{3} - x^{2} - 1.$ Given that $z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},$ and $z_{4}$ are the roots of $Q(x) = 0,$ find $P(z_{1}) + P(z_{2}) + P(z_{3}) + P(z_{4}).$
   <br />

- [AIME] For integers $a,b,c$ and $d,$ let $f(x)=x^2+ax+b$ and $g(x)=x^2+cx+d.$ Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of integers with absolute values not exceeding $10$ for which there is an integer $d$ such that $g(f(2))=g(f(4))=0.$
   <br />

- [AIME] Let $P(x) = x^2 - 3x - 7$, and let $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ be two quadratic polynomials also with the coefficient of $x^2$ equal to $1$. David computes each of the three sums $P + Q$, $P + R$, and $Q + R$ and is surprised to find that each pair of these sums has a common root, and these three common roots are distinct. If $Q(0) = 2$, then $R(0) = \frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.
   <br />

- [USAMO] In the polynomial $x^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984 = 0$, the product of $2$ of its roots is $- 32$. Find $k$.
