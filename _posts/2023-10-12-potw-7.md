### Problem
As shown in the figure, in $\triangle ABC$, the angle bisectors of the exterior angles of $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ intersect opposite sides at $D$ and $E$
respectively, and $AD = AB = BE$. Find the measure of angle A in degrees.

### Exercise Problem
- As shown in the diagram, $BE$ and $CF$ bisect $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$
respectively. $BE$ and $CF$ intersect at $G$. Given that $\angle BDC = 150^{\circ}$
and $\angle BGC = 100^{\circ}$, find $\angle A$ in degrees.
