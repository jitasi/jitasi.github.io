### Problem
As shown in the figure, in $\triangle ABC$, the angle bisectors of the exterior angles of $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ intersect opposite sides at $D$ and $E$
respectively, and $AD = AB = BE$. Find the measure of angle A in degrees.

### Hint
{% if page.publish_hint == "true" or jekyll.environment == "preview" %}

- This is a basic angle chasing problem.
- Mark the angles with identical measurements using the same variable and establish equations involving these variables. Then applying the angle chasing techniques to establish equations.
- Alternatively, we can start by assuming that the measures of angle $A$ is $x$ and apply the angle chasing techniques to represent other angles in the diagram with $x$.

### Solution 
{% if page.publish_solution == "true" or jekyll.environment == "preview" %}

**Solution 1:**

Let $\angle A = x$. Let's use the two-column proof to estable an equation of $x$.

| **statement** | **reason** |
|-----------|--------|
| 1) $AB=BE$   | 1) Given  |
| 2) $\angle CEB = \angle A = x$  | 2) Isosceles Triangle Theorem (equal sides opposite to equal angles) |
| 3) $\angle EBX = 2x$ | 3) Exterior Angle Theorem |
| 4) $\angle EBC = 2x$ | 4) Def. of Angle Bisector |
| 5) $\angle ABD = \angle CBX = 4x$ | 5) Vertical Angles Theorem |
| 6) $AD = AB$ | 6) Given |
| 7) $\angle ADB = \angle ABD = 4x$ | 7) Isosceles Triangle Theorem |
| 8) $\angle BAD = 180 - 8x$ | 8) Triangle Sum Theorem (Angle Sum Theorem) |
| 9) $\angle BAY = 360 - 16x$ | 9) Def. of Angle Bisector |
| 10) $\angle BAY + \angle A = 180$ | 10) Definition of supplementary angles OR Linear Pair Postulate |
| 11) $360 - 16x + x = 180$ | 11) PoE - substitution property of equality |

Solving the above equation gets $x = 12$. Therefore, the measure of angle A in degrees is $12$.

### Exercise Problem
- As shown in the diagram, $BE$ and $CF$ bisect $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$
respectively. $BE$ and $CF$ intersect at $G$. Given that $\angle BDC = 150^{\circ}$
and $\angle BGC = 100^{\circ}$, find $\angle A$ in degrees.
