### Problem
In triangle $ABC$, cevians $AD$ and $BE$ are drawn, intersecting at point $F$ and creating three smaller triangles and a quadrilateral. Given that the area of $\triangle AEF$ is $3$, the area of $\triangle ABF$ is $7$, and the area of â–³BFD is $7$, what is the area of the quadrilateral $CEFD$?

### Exercise Problem
- As illustrated in the diagram below, $\frac{AP}{PC}=\frac{4}{3}$, and $\frac{AQ}{QB}=\frac{3}{2}$, find the ratio of the areas between $\triangle AOB$ and $\triangle AOC$.

- In $\triangle ABC$, where $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of sides $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, line segments $BN$ and $CM$ intersect at point $P$. Find the ratio of $\frac{CP}{PM}$.
- Like the previous problem, but $AM = \lambda MB$, and $AN = \mu NC$, Find the ratio of $\frac{CP}{PM}$
