### Problem
In triangle $ABC$, cevians $AD$ and $BE$ are drawn, intersecting at point $F$ and creating three smaller triangles and a quadrilateral. Given that the area of $\triangle AEF$ is $3$, the area of $\triangle ABF$ is $7$, and the area of $\triangle BFD$ is $7$, what is the area of the quadrilateral $CEFD$?

### Hint
{% if page.publish_hint == "true" %}
- The triangle is a geometric shape that has the greatest variety of area formulas and properties associated with its area.
- When calculating the area of an irregular polygon, it is common practice to divide it into several triangles.
- The most well known formula for calculating the area of a triangle is $A=\frac{1}{2}bh$, which relies on two variables, namely the base ($b$) and the height ($h$). If we can hold one of these variables constant, we can establish a proportional relationship between the area and the other variable.

### Solution
{% if page.publish_solution == "true" %}
**Solution 1:** By connecting points $E$ and $D$, calculate the areas of $\triangle CED$ and $\triangle FDE$ separately.

Firstly, we have the length of $AF$ is equal to the length of $FD$ because $\triangle AFB$ and $\triangle DFB$ share the same height and have the same area.

Secondly, $\triangle AEF$ and $\triangle DEF$ should have the same area because they have the same height and have the same base length. So, the area of $\triangle DEF$ is 3.

Similarly, assume the aea of $\triangle CED$ is $x$, we find that

$$
\dfrac{[CEB]}{[AEB]} = \dfrac{CE}{AE} = \dfrac{[CED]}{[AED]}
$$

So,

$$
\dfrac{x + 10}{10} = \dfrac{x}{6}
$$

Solving the above equation, we get $x=15$. Hence, the area of the quadrilateral $CEFD$ is $18$.

**Solution 2:** By connecting points $C$ and $F$, calculate the areas of $\triangle CEF$ and $\triangle CDF$ separately.
  
  Assume the area of $\triangle CEF$ is $x$, and the area of $\triangle CDF$ is $y$. Now, our task is to determine the values of $x$ and $y$. 
  
  Firstly, we have the length of $AF$ is equal to the length of $FD$ because $\triangle AFB$ and $\triangle DFB$ share the same height and have the same area.
  
  Secondly, $\triangle ACF$ and $\triangle DCF$ should have the same area because they have the same height and have the same base length. So, we have the first equation $y = x + 3$.
  
  Similarly, we find that the length ratio of the line segment $EF$ to the line segment $FB$ is $3$ to $7$, so the area ratio of $\triangle CEF$ to $\triangle CEB$ is also $3$ to $7$.  Therefore, we have the second equation $\dfrac{x}{y+7} = \dfrac{3}{7}$.
  
  Finally, we have the following system of equations:
  
  $$
  \begin{cases}
    y = x + 3 \\
    \dfrac{x}{y+7} = \dfrac{3}{7}
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
  By solving this system of equations, we can determine
  
  $$
  \begin{cases}
    x = 7.5 \\
    y = 10.5
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
  Hence, the area of the quadrilateral $CEFD$ is $18$.
