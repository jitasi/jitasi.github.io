### Problem

A pyramid with a square base is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and $2$ units from the base. The surface area of the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top is half the surface area of the original pyramid. What is the altitude of the original pyramid?

### Hint
{% if page.publish_hint == "true" or jekyll.environment == "preview" %}
- It is imporatant to be aware that the smaller pyramid is similar to the original pyramid. 
- For similar geometry objects, regarless they are plane or solid, the ratio of area (surface area) is always the square of the similar ratio (the ratio of corresponding sides).
- It's noteworthy to highlight that, while not applicable to this particular problem, the volume ratio is always the cube of the similar ratio.
